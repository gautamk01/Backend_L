This is a simple node js programming demostrating the multi chat application using socket.io 

here in this application : 
1. we have to setup server 
2. then we have a basic html setup 
3. all the static website 
What are static files? These are files that the server sends directly to the client's browser without any server-side processing. Common examples include:
HTML files (.html)
CSS stylesheets (.css)
JavaScript client-side scripts (.js)
Images (.png, .jpg, .gif, etc.)
Fonts (.ttf, .woff, etc.)b browsers need these files to render a complete web page. When you visit a website, your browser makes requests for these static assets.

->Host static assets:
    Make your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other client-side files available to web browsers.
-> Simplify development: 
    You don't need to write separate routes for each static file; express.static handles it automatically.
-> Improve performance (in development):
    For small to medium-sized applications, serving static files directly from Express is convenient. In production, you might use a dedicated web server like Nginx or a CDN for better performance and scalability of static assets.

1. from the client the user will ask the ENter the username 
2. then the socket will emit the user name in join 
3. this will be listen by the socket in the server 
4. there is a set of username initiated  in the server 
5. it will add the user name to the set 
6. then it will emit username and username set (by converting the user array ) to all clients (broadcasting)
7. first handling the user join  and adding one div for username
