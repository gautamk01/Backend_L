Auth is a more important part 
register FOrm -> click Register -> This will be added to the mongodb
-> login page -> id and password -> login page 
                  public         -> public page

Normal user or admin user , both needed to be have a login but redoirect is different 
1.how auth works 
2. create cookies 
3. Role based auth (Role : user / admin)
4. logined in we have to store a cookies , for auth information 
5. if the user is authenticated you have to login 

6.let userid, email and password 
7.role default user 

bcryt -> this is a package we used to encrypt and decrypt the things inside the auth

when ever the user email and password -> we will create a token (hold the user information) -> valid for some minuetes -> basic level
we have to store the token in cookie 
login the user 

login controller : - 
1. getting the field from frontent 
2. find the current user 
3. if the user desn't existe then give an error message 
4. check if the password is correct or wrong
5. creating a token and returning the token 
6. this access token will hold all the information that we are storing here like user id , user name and role 

After Loged in : 
1. if user are a normal user -> you can go to certain pages :
2. if user are a admin user -> you can go to certain pages and some special pages :

we need to user middle ware to speperate these things : role based 
middleware -> check if the user is authenticated or not -> then check the token or verify the token -> ones this is done we can get user admin section
