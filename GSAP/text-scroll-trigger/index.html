            I am a Computer Engineering graduate with a passion for developing
            robust applications. My expertise lies in full-stack development,
            particularly with technologies like Next.js, and React. I have
            hands-on experience in building complex systems, including a
            multi-tenant SaaS platform and a RAG-based music recommendation
            engine. I am skilled in Python, JavaScript, and various machine
            learning frameworks.

            Currently pursuing a Master's degree at Vellore Institute of
            Technology, I am continuously exploring the frontiers of AI and web
            development. My project experience showcases my ability to lead
            teams, architect scalable solutions, and deliver innovative
            products. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can leverage my
            skills in LangChain, and modern web technologies to solve real-world
            problems.

            My technical skills include a strong command of Python, with
            libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn, alongside JavaScript and
            TypeScript for web development. I am proficient in creating
            interactive frontends with React and Next.js, and building robust
            backends using Node.js and Supabase.

            In the realm of AI and Machine Learning, I have developed a deep
            understanding of RAG architecture, utilizing LangChain, FAISS, and
            HuggingFace Transformers. My experience with databases like
            PostgreSQL and MongoDB, combined with my skills in Git and Vercel,
            allows me to manage the entire development lifecycle efficiently.
